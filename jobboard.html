        Many employment websites are designed to <br>allow employers to post job requirements for 
        a position to be filled<br> and are commonly known as job boards. Other employment sites 
        offer employer reviews.<br> <br>Career and job-search advice, and describe different job descriptions
         or employers. Through a job website, a prospective employee can locate and fill out a job
