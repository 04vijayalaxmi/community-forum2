        <h2>Forum will give you updated information </h2>
        <p>An Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where 
            people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. They differ 
            from chat rooms in that messages are often longer than one line of text, and 
            are at least temporarily archived. Also, depending on the access level of a user 
           the forum set-up, a posted message might need to be approved by a moderator before
            it becomes publicly visible.
